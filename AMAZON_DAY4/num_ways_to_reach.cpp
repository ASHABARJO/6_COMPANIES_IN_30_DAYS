/*
Let, r = right steps , l = left steps , diff = difference between startPos and endPos
now, eq 1 r - l = diff (as the overall difference of the steps must be equal to diff to reach our destination
eq 2 r + l = k ( as the total left and right steps should exactly be k )
Now after solving these simple equations, we get
r = (k + diff ) / 2 and l = (k - diff) / 2

We basically have to arrange k steps and return the overall number of arrangements , which will be k! .
In these k steps, r steps are identical to themselves and similarly l steps are identical to themselves

So our answer becomes => k! / (r! * l!)
After substituting the value of l = k-r from eq 2, our answer becomes
k! / (r! * (k-r)!) which is nothing but ---> kCr
